    <h1>disable gogaurdian [unreliable]</h1>
<p>
hi gays i was messing around at school and found a way to disable gogaurdian without any chrome urls and it’s pretty simple so like:

wait until your teacher opens the chat window thingy
spam the x button until it stops re-opening
open the url chrome-extension://<EXTENSIONIDHERE>/manifest.json
open chrome://extensions, go to your extension, and toggle the “allow access to file:// urls” switch
goguardian is now disabled and you can close both tabs
